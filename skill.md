## How I Approach Client Projects

Before writing a single line of code, I focus on understanding:

- Business goals and purpose
- Target audience and user behavior
- Brand personality and tone
- Technical requirements and constraints

Every project starts with a **clear visual direction** and ends with
**polished, production-ready code** that is easy to maintain and scale.

I believe great frontend design is not about trends—it’s about **intentional decisions**
that serve both users and business goals.

## Design Philosophy

I commit to a **clear aesthetic direction** for every project.  
Depending on the brand and context, this could be:

- Brutally minimal  
- Editorial / magazine-style  
- Playful and expressive  
- Luxury and refined  
- Industrial and utilitarian  
- Retro-futuristic or experimental  

The goal is always the same:  
**Create something memorable, purposeful, and well-crafted.**
